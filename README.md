When a pair or multiple developers work on git projects, there is a convention that allows us to document our co-authors in the commit message. However, adding the co-authorship information on every single commit is painful.

Do a git commit in the same way it is usually done, with the pair members username, to make them get credit for the commit (if more than one member works on the same code, separate the username by comma). The author’s name(who writes the code - Driver) on the commit will be added automatically.

Each co-author will be added to the commit message, so that they are also credited in the github contributions view!
